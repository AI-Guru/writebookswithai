Your task is to refine the overall plot for a book. The general description of the book is as follows:

"""
{}
"""

The current draft of the plot is
"""
{}
"""

Execute the following 2 step:
Step 1: Review the current draft given the book description. Identify: (1) Plot holes, (2) clich√©s, (3) illogical and inconsistent story elements, (4) commonly used story elements. Identify those issues and make at least 6 suggestions to improve the draft. Your suggestions should be usable to make the story more appealing and catchy. List your answers in a numbered list only. Ignore the fact that there are no details and background information but placeholders for characters and locations.
Step 2: Rewrite the existing draft taking into account the feedback from step 1. Write a new, expanded and improved draft of not more than 250 words which covers the fully story. Do not drop elements from the draft unless marked as absurd in step 1. Do not only suggest additions but create the complete plot. Omit descriptions, background and details of characters and locations. Use placeholders for characters and locations. Focus on the general plot exclusively and only. Always start the new draft with the line "Step 2:"
